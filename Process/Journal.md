## Game Analysis
### *Tiny Rogues!*
My current obsession!!\
[link to steam page...](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2088570/Tiny_Rogues/)

I got into it a year ago, and then recently went back due to a huge content update. It's a one man show game that's still in early access, with a lot of plans for future content. In brief, it’s a bullet hell roguelite where the player descends 10 levels to kill a final boss. Fun no?

**Meta Progression:**\
One of my favorite things about the game is the “meta progression”. On first launch, Tiny Rogues was fresh off of the Vampire Survivors hype, including a similar meta progression chart. I wasn’t a really big fan of it the first time I played, since it was just used to make the roguelike “easier”. But… this update… completely reworked the chart. Now turned into a tree, there are 4 quadrants that branch from a common center, each offering different “meta progression” style rewards, ranging from making the game easier to harder! Each quadrant focuses on its own set of skill upgrades: Challenges (hard mode), Luck (easy mode), Loot, Shop. Each quadrant also functions as its own mini tree, meaning that you can only reach the end of the skill tree by unlocking nodes that connect to the ones before it. The element that makes this system great, however, is the fact that any skill selected can be unselected for free, with no external cost to the player. This design decision means that the player can easily customize every single run depending on the challenges they want to undertake! 

Another aspect of this skill tree is the fact that “easy mode” is not immediately unlockable, needing around 3-4 levels of progress within the game. This subtly forces the player to at least try their hand at the game normally, and by that point they should learn enough of it to not need an easier game mode! I appreciate the option still being there though. 

**Accessibility:**\
Honorable mention to the graphic’s accessibility. Tiny Rogues uses two big visual filters to give the screen a vhs effect. This, in turn, means that light sensitive people can’t play it due to how much the screen shake, the blown up screen and the glitch lines interact with the game's projectiles. In the settings, RubyDev has implemented a slider for the players to customize how present these filters are (from all of them to none of them)!

## PrototypingStage1

//first stage of prorotyping process
- what was your idea
- what specific questions where you trying to answer (goals)
- was is a look/feel, role or implementation prorotype
- what fidelity are you dealing with
- what did you learn
- what are the next steps
