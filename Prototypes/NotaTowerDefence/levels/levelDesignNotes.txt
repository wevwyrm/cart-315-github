:) 

Design Notes:
-------------
1. when creating/putting down things, make sure u have both grid snap AND smart snap on
2. current tiles are at 64x64, if changed make sure to also change it for the player


Base Necessities Checklist:
---------------------------
	DONE - player can collide into enemy but cant move into them
		IMPORTANT == collisions need to  be specifically set to match the 64x64 tile constraints 
					 this means, enemies gotta be in the middle of that 64x64, and be mindful of the path 
					 (make chart for tile placement :) )
	DONE - player can cross path so long as no enemy ontop
	DONE - any action (ie moving, playing cards, upgrading) moves enemy forward
	
	- enemy health
	- end goal health 
	- game over screen
	- main menu
	- global countdown 


Quality of Life Checklist:
--------------------------
	- counter that fills up before ennemi movies
	- visible enemy health
	- visible player health?


BRAIN ROT
=========
	is the player part of the ending? or is that a seperate thing
	goal to defeat enemies before counter drops to 0 or player dies? 
	enemies do timer damage
	do i even want health on the main tower? 
	
	lost turn per enemy? enemy stays there for x turn, each turn an enemy is there they make u lose a timer\
	> incentive to kill the ones in the back as much as the front
	
	> split paths? just in case...
	
	> check out game zipper, if its not fun, then what can u do about it
	> how to make it visually see whats going on lmfao
